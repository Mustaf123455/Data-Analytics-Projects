# us_medical_insurance_costs
Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to analyse medical insurance costs in the us. 
I looked at each factor potentially impacting the insurance costs which included age, bmi, gender, region and etc
I wanted to see which of the subcategories of these had the highest insurance costs and I found the value for each of them and printed out the value along with a statement.

key findings: 
Males tend to spend more on average on medical insurance with an amount of 13956.751177721893 USD
people with higher bmis then the average payed more on insurance costs with an amount of 15801.788405743035 USD
people with a higher age had more insurance costs with an amount of 16430.512562364456 USD
people with three children tend to payer higher medical insurance costs with an amount of 15355.318366815285 USD
The average smoker payed more with an amount of 32050.23183153285 USD
The people in the south east payed the most amount of insurance with an amount of 14735.41143760989 USD


My reflection:
After completing this project I now understand healthcare trends better than before and with it hope that agencies can come up with better policies while adjusting their funding to insure that all people have equal access to healthcare. Elderly people and smokers are an example of the people who payed more on average for their healthcare. These people need better programs dispatched by healthcare companies and the government to ensure that they do not incur large amounts ofdebt to battle their condition.
